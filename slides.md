# What is Infrastructure as Code?

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

- With IaC, infrastructure is defined in code, allowing for automated provisioning, configuration, and management of infrastructure resources.

- IaC enables consistency, scalability, and repeatability in infrastructure deployment and management processes.

# Overview of Terraform

- Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp.
  
- It enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

- Terraform allows for the management of infrastructure across various cloud providers (such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) as well as on-premises environments.

# Terraform Basics

- **Declarative vs. Imperative Approach**: Terraform follows a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of your infrastructure, rather than specifying the exact steps to achieve it.

- **Terraform Configuration Language (HCL)**: HCL is a simple, human-readable language used to define Terraform configurations. It allows you to describe infrastructure components and their relationships.

- **Infrastructure Management**: Terraform manages infrastructure resources through the use of providers and resources. Providers are responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources provided by a specific cloud or service.

# Terraform Architecture

- **Components**: Terraform architecture consists of several components, including providers, resources, state files, and modules. Providers are responsible for interacting with APIs of various cloud providers.

- **Provider Plugins**: Terraform uses provider plugins to interface with different cloud providers. These plugins abstract the underlying API calls and provide a consistent interface for managing resources.

- **State Management**: Terraform maintains a state file that records the current state of your infrastructure. This state file is used to track the relationship between your configuration and the real-world infrastructure.

# Getting Started with Terraform

- **Installation and Setup**: Install Terraform CLI, initialize a new project with `terraform init`.

- **Writing Your First Configuration**: Create a `.tf` file, declare provider and resources.

- **Common Commands**: Use `terraform plan` to preview changes, `terraform apply` to apply changes, and `terraform destroy` to remove resources.

---

# Terraform Workflow

- **Planning (`terraform plan`)**: Generate an execution plan showing what Terraform will do when you apply your configuration. It helps you understand the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure.

- **Applying Changes (`terraform apply`)**: Apply the changes described in the Terraform configuration to your infrastructure. Terraform will create, update, or delete resources as necessary to match the desired state.

- **Destroying Resources (`terraform destroy`)**: Destroy the resources defined in your Terraform configuration. Use with caution as it permanently deletes infrastructure resources.

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

</div>

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Motions

Motion animations are powered by [@vueuse/motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/), triggered by `v-motion` directive.

```html

  :enter="{ x: 0 }"
  :click-3="{ x: 80 }"
  :leave="{ x: 1000 }"

  Slidev
</div>
```

<div class="w-60 relative">
  <div class="relative w-40 h-40">

# Monaco Editor

Slidev provides built-in Monaco Editor support.

Add `{monaco}` to the code block to turn it into an editor:

```ts {monaco}
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray } from './external'

const arr = ref(emptyArray(10))
```

Use `{monaco-run}` to create an editor that can execute the code directly in the slide:

```ts {monaco-run}
import { version } from 'vue'
import { emptyArray, sayHello } from './external'

sayHello()
console.log(`vue ${version}`)
console.log(emptyArray<number>(10).reduce(fib => [...fib, fib.at(-1)! + fib.at(-2)!], [1, 1]))
```
